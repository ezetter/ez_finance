# EZ Finance

### About

An EZ way to manage your personal investments. You can add retirement, brokerage and mutual fund accounts with values. This app will allow you to filter, see totals for various account categories,etc. It also keeps track of historical values as you update those values and allows viewing that history to see your portfolio performance over time.

### Portfolio Analysis

EZ Finance also has analysis facilities. It allows you to play with various growth scenarios to compare future values. You can try different growth rates and annual contribution amounts. You can see this as both a table and a graph. You can compare multiple scenarios side by side on both the graph and table view.

## Installation

This is a Ruby on Rails project so however you deploy and run your Rails projects is the mechanism. I haven't at this point provided any facilities within the project, e.g. Capistrano.

You do need a database and should create the database the standard Rails way (e.g. rake db:create). I used PostreSQL. Other relational databases should work but are untested.
